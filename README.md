# Hospital_Data_Analysis
Hello, this is my first data analysis project. It was a excellent first project to get started with Data Analysis.

In this project I was able to learn how to use different python library such as pandas and matplotlyb. 
In this project I did a lot of DataFrame and Series manipulation (merging, pivot of a DataFrame).

I learned how to improve my own dataset, by delting the empty rows, correcting all the columns that could be fixed, replacing all the NaN
that were found in the DataFrame or Series into actual values.

After learning how to improve a dataset. I was able to do some statistics with the data, to answer some questions about the all the data.

The statistics questions:
Which  hospital has the highest number of patients, 
What share of the patients in the general hospital suffer from stomach-related issues ?
What share of the patients in the sports hospital suffers from dislocated issues ?
What is the difference in the median ages of the patients in the general and sports hospitals ?
In which hospital the blood test was teken the most often ? And How many blood tests were taken ?

And then finally I Visualized the data with the help of matplotlib.pyplot .
